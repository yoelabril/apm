        Used by non-skill integrators to silently *adopt* a pre-existing
        on-disk file that already matches what APM would deploy.

        Why this exists
        ---------------
        Without this short-circuit, the per-file loops in
        ``agent_integrator``, ``instruction_integrator``, ``prompt_integrator``
        and ``command_integrator`` would route the file straight into
        :meth:`check_collision`. When the path is missing from
        ``managed_files`` (e.g. lockfile was wiped, hand-edited, regenerated
        by an older APM build, or the user's previous install crashed before
        ``deployed_files`` was persisted) the file is treated as
        "user-authored", *skipped*, and never appended to ``target_paths``.

        That in turn leaves ``deployed_files`` empty in the new lockfile,
        which trips the ``required-packages-deployed`` policy check at the
        next install. Because ``policy_gate`` runs *before* ``integrate``
        in ``pipeline.py``, the install can never self-heal -- a permanent
        catch-22 lockout.

        ``skill_integrator`` already has an equivalent content-identity
        adopt at ``_promote_sub_skills`` (target.exists() +
        ``_dirs_equal``). This helper restores symmetry for non-skill
        primitives.

        Conservative by design
        ----------------------
        Only fires for *byte-identical* matches. Format-transforming
        targets (``codex_agent``, ``cursor_rules``, ``claude_rules``,
        ``windsurf_rules``, ``gemini_command``, ...) won't match -- they
        keep the existing skip behavior. This means we never silently
        adopt content that *might* have come from somewhere else; we only
        adopt files that are demonstrably the package's own bytes already
        on disk.

        TOCTOU hardening
        ----------------
        The classic ``is_symlink()`` -> ``read_bytes()`` sequence has a
        race window: a hostile co-tenant on the same machine could swap
        a regular file for a symlink between the two calls and cause
        ``read_bytes()`` to follow it to an attacker-controlled path,
        whose bytes might match source by construction. We close the
        race by reading through ``os.open(..., O_NOFOLLOW)`` so the
        kernel rejects the open atomically if the final component is a
        symlink. ``O_NOFOLLOW`` is a no-op constant on platforms that
        lack it (Windows), where the upfront ``is_symlink()`` check
        plus ``ensure_path_within`` at the call site provide adequate
        coverage (Windows also lacks the cheap unprivileged-symlink
        creation primitive that makes this race practical on POSIX).
