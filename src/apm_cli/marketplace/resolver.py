"""Resolve ``NAME@MARKETPLACE`` specifiers to canonical ``owner/repo#ref`` strings.

The ``@`` disambiguation rule:
- If input matches ``^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+$`` (no ``/``, no ``:``),
  it is a marketplace ref.
- Everything else goes to the existing ``DependencyReference.parse()`` path.
- These inputs previously raised ``ValueError`` ("Use 'user/repo' format"),
  so this is a backward-compatible grammar extension.

For marketplaces on hosts where FQDN shorthand cannot split nested paths safely
(``gitlab.com``, self-managed GitLab **even when not** listed in ``GITLAB_HOST``,
and other non-GitHub / non-ADO FQDNs such as ``git.example.com``), in-marketplace
plugin sources under a subdirectory of the marketplace repository are resolved to a
:class:`~apm_cli.models.dependency.reference.DependencyReference` built like explicit
``git:`` + ``path:``; clone target
is only the registered marketplace project; the plugin directory is ``virtual_path``.
``github.com`` and ``*.ghe.com`` keep shorthand (no structured ref); ``*.ghe.com``
canonicals additionally carry a host prefix so downstream auth resolves at the
enterprise host instead of falling back to ``github.com`` (#1285).
:func:`resolve_marketplace_plugin` returns
:class:`MarketplacePluginResolution`, which iterates as ``(canonical, plugin)`` so
existing ``canonical, plugin = resolve_marketplace_plugin(...)`` call sites keep
working; consumers that need the structured ref use ``result.dependency_reference``.

    """Signal that a cross-repo dict ``type: github`` source on an enterprise
    GitHub-family marketplace declares a bare ``owner/repo`` whose canonical
    falls back to ``github.com`` -- the same syntactic ambiguity that powers
    a dependency-confusion attack (#1326, formerly diagnosed only as #1305).

    Attached to :class:`MarketplacePluginResolution` when the marketplace is on
    ``*.ghe.com`` and the plugin's dict source declares a bare ``owner/repo``
    that does not match the marketplace project. The resolver deliberately
    leaves these canonicals bare (PR #1292 scoped its host backfill to
    in-marketplace sources), so ``DependencyReference.parse`` defaults the host
    to ``github.com``. Two intents share this syntax -- a legitimate cross-host
    ``github.com`` open-source dep, or a misconfigured same-host entry that
    should have been ``corp.ghe.com/owner/repo`` -- and the resolver cannot
    distinguish them.

    Consumer contract (#1326): the install command consults this sentinel
    BEFORE any outbound validation HTTP call and refuses the package
    fail-closed when it is non-``None``. The earlier #1305 design surfaced
    only an advisory hint on validation failure, which left the success
    path (attacker pre-stages the bare namespace on public github.com)
    silently exploitable. Cross-host explicit qualification by the
    marketplace author -- ``repo: github.com/owner/repo`` -- prevents
    the sentinel from attaching at the resolver layer (see
    :func:`_compute_cross_repo_misconfig_risk`), which is the supported
    escape hatch for declared cross-host intent.
