"""Pure drift-detection helpers for diff-aware ``apm install``.

These functions are stateless and side-effect-free, making them easy to test
in isolation and to reuse from multiple call sites in ``install.py`` without
duplicating logic.

Four kinds of drift are detected:

* **Ref drift** — the ``ref`` pinned in ``apm.yml`` differs from what the
  lockfile recorded as ``resolved_ref``.  This includes transitions such as
  ``None → "v1.0.0"`` (user adds a pin), ``"main" → None`` (user removes a
  pin), ``"v1.0.0" → "v2.0.0"`` (user bumps the pin), and hash-based pins
  (``None → "abc1234"`` or ``"abc1234" → "def5678"``).

* **Orphan drift** — packages present in the lockfile but absent from the
  current manifest.  Their deployed files should be removed.

* **Config drift** — an already-installed dependency's serialised configuration
  differs from the baseline stored in the lockfile.  (Currently only MCP
  servers; extendable to other integrator types.)

* **Stale-file drift** -- files previously deployed for a still-present
  package that are no longer produced by the current install (e.g. a
  rename or removal inside the package).  The now-unused paths should be
  removed.  See :func:`detect_stale_files`.

Scope / non-goals
-----------------
* **Hash-based refs** — handled identically to branch/tag refs: both
  ``dep_ref.reference`` and ``locked_dep.resolved_ref`` store the raw ref
  string from ``apm.yml``/lockfile respectively, so a change from
  ``"abc1234"`` to ``"def5678"`` is detected just like ``"v1.0" → "v2.0"``.

* **URL format changes** — transparent.  ``DependencyReference.parse()``
  normalises all input formats (HTTPS, SSH, shorthand, FQDN) into the same
  canonical ``repo_url`` before the lockfile stores them.  Changing
  ``owner/repo`` to ``https://github.com/owner/repo.git`` in ``apm.yml`` is a
  formatting-only change that produces the same unique key and is correctly
  treated as no drift.

* **Host changes** — *not* detected.  If a user changes the host of an otherwise
  identical package, the unique key may not change and ``detect_ref_change()``
  will not signal a re-download.  Host-level changes still require the user to
  ``apm remove`` + ``apm install`` the package, or use ``--update``.
* **HTTP transport flips** — detected.  Switching between HTTPS and insecure
  HTTP toggles ``is_insecure`` and forces a re-download even when the package
  identity and ref are otherwise unchanged.
