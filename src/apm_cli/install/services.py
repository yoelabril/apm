"""Package integration services.

The two functions in this module own the *integration template* for a single
package -- looping over the resolved targets, dispatching primitives to their
integrators, accumulating counters, and recording deployed file paths.

Moved here from ``apm_cli.commands.install`` so that the install engine
package owns its own integration logic.  ``commands/install`` keeps thin
underscore-prefixed re-exports for backward compatibility with existing
``@patch`` sites and direct imports.

Design notes
------------
``integrate_local_content()`` calls ``integrate_package_primitives()`` via a
bare-name lookup so that ``@patch`` of either symbol on this module's
namespace intercepts both call paths consistently.
