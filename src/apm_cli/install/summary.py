"""Final-summary rendering for ``apm install``.

Extracted from ``apm_cli.commands.install`` to keep the command file
under its architectural LOC budget while we layer on the perf+UX
findings F1-F7 (microsoft/apm#1116). This module is a *pure* renderer:
it takes already-collected diagnostics, formats them through the
``InstallLogger``, and decides whether the command should hard-fail on
critical security findings.

Keeping it free of the install pipeline state (no ``InstallContext``)
lets the unit tests exercise summary behaviour without spinning up
sources, locks, or filesystem fixtures.
