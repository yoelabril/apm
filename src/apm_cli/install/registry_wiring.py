"""Install-phase glue for the dedicated package registry (REST), not HTTP client logic.

``deps.registry`` owns fetching and verifying registry packages. This module
owns how the install pipeline reads ``InstallContext.registry_resolver`` and
lockfile rows to populate ``InstalledPackage.registry_resolution`` — i.e.
orchestration only, kept out of ``sources.py`` so that file stays strategy-shaped.

    Two sources, so the lockfile keeps ``resolved_url``, ``resolved_hash``, and
    ``version`` when the package is reused from disk instead of re-downloaded:

    1. The resolver's ``last_resolutions`` map — filled when the BFS callback in
       ``resolve.py`` just downloaded this dep during dependency-graph resolution
       (e.g. first install with no prior lockfile). This path was the bug fix.
    2. The existing lockfile row — used on re-install when the tree is already on
       disk and was verified earlier (original phase-7 wiring).
