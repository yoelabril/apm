"""Dependency sources -- Strategy pattern for the install pipeline.

Each ``DependencySource`` knows how to *acquire* one dependency: bring its
files onto disk, build a ``PackageInfo``, register it in the lockfile-bound
state, and return the metadata the integration template needs.

After ``acquire()``, all sources flow through the same template
(``apm_cli.install.template.run_integration_template``) which handles the
security gate, primitive integration, and per-package diagnostics.

This module deliberately contains *only* source-specific logic.  Anything
shared across sources lives in the template.

Sources
-------
- ``LocalDependencySource``: ``file://`` deps copied from the workspace.
- ``CachedDependencySource``: deps already extracted in ``apm_modules/``.
- ``FreshDependencySource``: deps that need a network download (with
  supply-chain hash verification on top of the existing lockfile entry).

The root-project integration (``<project_root>/.apm/``) follows a
substantially different shape (no PackageInfo, dedicated tracking on
``ctx.local_deployed_files``) and is handled separately in
``phases/integrate.py``.
