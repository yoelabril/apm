"""Parallel package pre-download phase.

Reads ``ctx.deps_to_install``, ``ctx.existing_lockfile``,
``ctx.update_refs``, ``ctx.parallel_downloads``, ``ctx.apm_modules_dir``,
``ctx.downloader``, and ``ctx.callback_downloaded``; populates
``ctx.pre_download_results`` (dep_key -> PackageInfo) and
``ctx.pre_downloaded_keys`` (set of dep_keys that were pre-downloaded).

This is Phase 4 (#171) of the install pipeline.  Packages that were already
fetched during BFS resolution (callback_downloaded), local packages, and
those whose lockfile SHA matches the on-disk HEAD are skipped.  Remaining
packages are fetched in parallel via :class:`ThreadPoolExecutor` with a Rich
progress UI.  Failures are silently swallowed -- the sequential integration
loop is the source of truth for error reporting.
