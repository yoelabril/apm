"""Sequential integration phase -- per-package integration loop.

Reads all prior phase outputs from *ctx* (resolve, targets, download) and
processes each dependency sequentially.  Per-source acquisition is handled
by ``DependencySource`` Strategy implementations
(``apm_cli.install.sources``); the shared post-acquire flow (security gate
+ primitive integration + diagnostics) lives in the Template Method
``apm_cli.install.template.run_integration_template``.

After the dependency loop, root-project primitives (``<project_root>/.apm/``)
are integrated when present (#714) -- this path is structurally distinct
(no ``PackageInfo``, dedicated ``ctx.local_deployed_files`` tracking) so it
remains a sibling helper here rather than a fourth ``DependencySource``.
