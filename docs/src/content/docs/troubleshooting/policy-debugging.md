title: Debugging policy failures
description: Diagnose blocked installs and audits, inspect resolved org policy, and apply the right escape hatch.

When `apm install` or `apm audit --ci` blocks the project on policy, the
job is not to silence it -- it is to figure out **which rule fired,
where the policy came from, and whether the right fix is in your
project, in the org policy, or a one-shot escape hatch.**

This page walks the diagnosis end to end.

## 1. Read the failure

A policy block looks roughly like this:

```text
[x] policy: dependency-allowlist
    severity: error
    message:  Dependency 'acme-corp/internal-skills' is not on the
              org allowlist.
    evidence: apm.yml -> dependencies.apm[2]
    source:   acme-corp/.github/apm-policy.yml
```

Three things to extract before doing anything else:

- **Rule id** (`dependency-allowlist`) -- pin it; you will reuse it in the
  next steps.
- **Severity** (`error` blocks; `warning` does not).
- **Source** -- the org policy file that owns the rule. If you do not
  recognize it, jump straight to step 2.

## 2. Ask "which policy ruled on me?"

`apm policy status` prints the resolved policy posture for the current
project, with no side effects. Run it from the project root:

```bash
apm policy status
```

```text
APM Policy Status
-----------------
  Outcome        found
  Source         acme-corp/.github/apm-policy.yml
  Enforcement    enforce
  Cache age      4m ago
  Extends chain  acme-corp/.github/apm-policy.yml
  Effective rules  dependency: 2 rule(s); mcp: 3 rule(s); manifest: 1 rule(s)
```

Useful flags:

- `--no-cache` -- skip the policy cache and refetch from GitHub.
- `--policy-source <ref>` -- override discovery (e.g. `org`, a repo
  ref, or a local path) to test what *would* apply.
- `-o json` -- machine-readable for scripting and SIEM ingest.
- `--check` -- exit non-zero when no usable policy is resolved (CI
  pre-check). Default exit is always `0`.

If `Outcome` is anything other than `found`, the discovery itself
failed. Common causes: missing GitHub token, private `.github` repo,
network egress blocked. The `Notice:` line at the bottom of the report
explains which.

For the full command surface, see [`apm policy`](../reference/cli/policy/).

## 3. Inheritance and merge

Org policies can `extends:` other policies. The effective policy is the
**tighten-only merge** of the chain: a child can make rules stricter,
never looser.

```text
Extends chain  acme-corp/.github/apm-policy.yml
               -> acme-corp/policy-base@v3
```

Common surprises:

- A child adds an entry to `dependency.allow` but the parent's
  `dependency.deny` still applies -- denies always win.
- A child sets `mcp.transport.allow: [stdio, http]` but the parent
  pinned `[http]` -- the child's broader list is ignored.
- Severity can only be raised by a child, never lowered.

The full merge semantics live in
[Policy schema -> Merge rules (tighten-only)](../reference/policy-schema/#merge-rules-tighten-only).
Read that section before arguing with a parent policy.

## 4. Discovery surprises

APM resolves policy in this order:

1. `--policy-source <ref>` on `apm policy status`, or `--policy <ref>`
   on `apm audit --ci`. Explicit always wins.
2. Project-local `apm.yml` (`policy:` block, if present).
3. Auto-discovery: `<owner>/.github/apm-policy.yml` for the repo's
   GitHub owner.
4. None -- no enforcement.

Things that bite:

- **Wrong owner.** Auto-discovery uses the *current repo's* GitHub
  owner. If your fork is under a personal account, the org policy
  will not auto-apply. Use `apm policy status --policy-source org`
  to test against the upstream owner.
- **Stale cache.** Policy is cached on disk. If an admin just rolled
  out a fix, run with `--no-cache` (or `apm install --refresh ...`).
- **Discovery silently disabled.** `APM_POLICY_DISABLE=1` in the
  shell environment skips discovery for **every** APM command in that
  session. See the call-out below.

### Escape hatches

Two exist. Both are loud on purpose.

| Mechanism | Scope | Skips |
|---|---|---|
| `apm install --no-policy` | Single invocation | Org policy gate during install only. Does **not** bypass `apm audit --ci`. |
| `APM_POLICY_DISABLE=1` | Entire shell session | All policy discovery and enforcement, in every APM command. |

:::caution
`APM_POLICY_DISABLE=1` is session-wide and applies to install, audit,
compile, and unpack. Set it for one command (`APM_POLICY_DISABLE=1 apm
install`) -- never `export` it in a shell profile.
:::

Both flags are documented in
[Environment variables](../reference/environment-variables/).

## 5. Common rules that block

These cover most real-world failures. Each lists the symptom and the
shortest path to green.

### `dependency-allowlist` / `dependency-denylist`

- **Symptom:** `Dependency '<owner>/<repo>' is not on the org
  allowlist` (or `is on the org denylist`).
- **Fix:** Replace the dep with an allowed equivalent, or open a PR
  against the org policy file to add it (see step 6).

### `mcp-transport` excluding `stdio`

- **Symptom:** `MCP server '<name>' uses transport 'stdio' which is
  not on the allowed transport list`.
- **Cause:** Org has narrowed transports to remote-only (`http`,
  `sse`) and your `apm.yml` pins a stdio command.
- **Fix:** Re-install the server from the registry with `--url` (HTTP
  endpoint). If no remote endpoint exists, escalate to the org admin.

### `mcp-self-defined`

- **Symptom:** `Self-defined MCP server '<name>' is not allowed; only
  registry-resolved servers are permitted`.
- **Cause:** Org requires every MCP server to come from the registry,
  not be hand-rolled in `apm.yml`.
- **Fix:** Find the server in the registry and `apm install
  mcp:<name>`. Remove the hand-rolled entry.

### `required-manifest-fields`

- **Symptom:** `Required manifest field 'description' is missing from
  apm.yml`.
- **Fix:** Edit `apm.yml` and add the listed field. Org policy
  defines the required set; check
  [Policy schema](../reference/policy-schema/).

### `unmanaged-files`

- **Symptom:** `Unmanaged file detected in target directory:
  .github/instructions/extra.md`.
- **Cause:** A hand-edited file in a target directory APM owns. With
  `action: deny`, any file APM did not write blocks the build.
- **Fix:** Either move the file out of the target directory, or
  promote it to a real APM primitive in a package. See
  [Baseline checks](../reference/baseline-checks/) for the underlying
  CI check.

## 6. Working with org admins

Pick the right ask:

- **Fix the project** when: your dep is genuinely off-policy (a fork,
  unmaintained, replaced by an org-blessed alternative), or you can
  swap to a registry-listed MCP server.
- **Ask for an allowlist addition** when: the dep is critical, has no
  org-blessed equivalent, and meets the org's review bar.

When you open the PR against the org policy repo:

1. Link the failing CI run (or the `apm policy status` JSON output).
2. Quote the exact rule id and source line.
3. Link the org policy file you are amending so reviewers do not have
   to hunt for it.

see [Governance deep-dive](../enterprise/governance-guide/) and
