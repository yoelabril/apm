This page documents APM's security posture for enterprise security reviews, compliance audits, and supply chain assessments.

## Threat model

APM defends the build-time supply chain for AI agent context: prompts, instructions, skills, hooks, and MCP server declarations flowing from a git source through `apm install` into your project tree and on into supported harnesses. The defended properties are reproducibility (same install everywhere), integrity (downloaded content matches the lockfile), provenance (every dep traces to a pinned commit at a named host), and pre-deploy content safety (no hidden Unicode reaches the agent). APM does NOT sandbox MCP servers at runtime, does not do malware analysis on dependency code, does not sign packages, and does not inspect what an agent does once it has read your context.

## The prompt supply chain is different

Traditional package managers install code that sits inert until a developer or CI pipeline explicitly executes it. Between `npm install` and `npm start`, there is a gap — time for `npm audit`, code review, and policy checks.

**Agent configuration has no such gap.** The moment a skill, instruction, or prompt file lands in `.github/prompts/` or `.claude/agents/`, any IDE agent watching the filesystem — Copilot, Cursor, Claude Code — may already be ingesting it. There is no "execution step." File presence IS execution.

This changes the security model fundamentally. APM treats package deployment as a **pre-deployment gate**: scan first, deploy only if clean.

## What APM does

APM is a build-time dependency manager for AI agent configuration. It performs four operations:

1. **Resolves git repositories** — clones or sparse-checks-out packages from GitHub or Azure DevOps.
2. **Deploys static files** — copies markdown, JSON, and YAML files into project directories (`.github/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.opencode/`).
3. **Generates compiled output** — produces `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and similar files from templates and prompts.
4. **Records a lock file** — writes `apm.lock.yaml` with exact commit SHAs for every resolved dependency.

## What APM does NOT do

APM has no runtime footprint. Once `apm install` or `apm compile` completes, the process exits.

- **No runtime component.** APM generates files then terminates. It does not run alongside your application.
- **No network calls after install (by default).** All network activity (git clone/fetch) occurs during dependency resolution. There are no callbacks or phone-home requests. (**Scripts exception:** opt-in [lifecycle scripts](/apm/enterprise/lifecycle-scripts/) may send HTTPS POST requests, but only from policy- or user-installed script files, or project script files you have explicitly trusted -- see the [lifecycle scripts trust model](/apm/enterprise/lifecycle-scripts/#trust-model).)
- **No arbitrary code execution (by default).** APM does not execute scripts from packages, evaluate expressions in templates, or run downloaded code. (**Scripts exception:** opt-in [lifecycle scripts](/apm/enterprise/lifecycle-scripts/) may run shell commands, but project-source scripts are skipped unless you explicitly trust them with `apm lifecycle trust`; policy and user scripts originate from sources you already control. See the [trust model](/apm/enterprise/lifecycle-scripts/#trust-model).) (**Canvas exception:** the experimental `canvas` primitive deploys executable `extension.mjs` (Node.js) code to `.github/extensions/` or `~/.copilot/extensions/`; this surface is gated by both the `canvas` experimental flag and the [executable trust gate](#executable-trust-gate) for dependency-provided canvases. See [Canvas extensions](/apm/integrations/canvas/).)
- **No access to application data.** APM never reads databases, API responses, application state, or user data.
- **No persistent background processes.** APM does not install daemons, services, or scheduled tasks.
- **No telemetry or data collection.** APM collects no usage data, analytics, or diagnostics. Nothing is transmitted to Microsoft or any third party.

## Dependency provenance

APM resolves dependencies directly from git repositories. There is no intermediary registry, proxy, or mirror.

### Exact commit pinning

Every resolved dependency is recorded in `apm.lock.yaml` with its full commit SHA:

```yaml
lockfile_version: "1"
dependencies:
  - repo_url: owner/repo
    host: github.com
    resolved_commit: a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f234567890abcdef12
    resolved_ref: main
    depth: 1
    deployed_files:
      - .github/skills/example/skill.md
```

The `resolved_commit` field is a full 40-character SHA, not a branch name or tag. Subsequent `apm install` calls resolve to the same commit unless the lock file is explicitly updated. For manifest entries that are themselves pinned to a full SHA, `apm update` resolves only annotated semver tags from the authoritative upstream; branches and lightweight tags are not accepted for this revision-pin update path. See [`apm update`](../reference/cli/update/) for the rewrite mechanics.

### Registry security model

By default, APM resolves dependencies as git repository URLs, eliminating the centralized-registry compromise vector.

The experimental `registries` feature adds REST-based package sources. When enabled:

- **Byte-level reproducibility.** `resolved_hash` in `apm.lock.yaml` is a SHA-256 digest of the downloaded archive. Re-installs verify bytes against the lockfile hash before writing to disk. A mismatch **fails closed** — the install aborts before any archive contents are extracted.
- **Token containment.** Tokens for registry auth MUST NOT appear in repo-tracked YAML files. APM hard-fails if a `token:` key is found in `apm.yml` or `apm-policy.yml`. Tokens belong in `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_<NAME>` env vars or `~/.apm/config.json`.
- **Policy enforcement.** The `registry_source` block in `apm-policy.yml` lets platform teams mandate specific registries and block non-registry sources. Checks apply transitively.

**Known limitations:**

- **No package signing.** The `resolved_hash` detects corruption and post-download tampering but does not verify publisher identity. Package signing is a planned hardening item.
- **SBOM inventory, not provenance attestations.** `apm lock export` can emit CycloneDX or SPDX from the lockfile, but this is not signed and does not include SLSA provenance.
- **SHA-256 floor only.** The hash algorithm is fixed at SHA-256 with no upgrade path to SHA-384/512.

APM provides **dependency governance**: controlled sources, locked versions, and byte-level verification of downloaded content. It does not sign packages or emit SLSA-compliant provenance. Treat installed packages with the same diligence you apply to any external dependency, and describe the guarantees as **APM dependency governance** in compliance documentation rather than as supply-chain signing or attestation.

### HTTP (insecure) dependencies

APM supports `http://` git dependencies for private mirrors and air-gapped
environments, but only behind explicit approval on both the manifest and CLI
surfaces:

- `allow_insecure: true` on the dependency entry records that the project
  intentionally permits HTTP for that dependency.
- `apm install --allow-insecure` approves direct HTTP dependencies for the
  current install run.
- Transitive HTTP dependencies inherit approval only when they come from the
  same host as an approved direct HTTP dependency. Additional transitive hosts
  require `--allow-insecure-host HOSTNAME`.

These controls make the decision visible, but they do **not** make HTTP safe:

- HTTP has no transport encryption or server authentication. A machine-in-the-middle can modify repository contents or refs in transit.
- On the first HTTP fetch (or any update fetched over HTTP), the lockfile's `resolved_commit` and `content_hash` come from that same untrusted channel. They improve replay detection later, but they do not establish trustworthy provenance for the initial fetch.
- APM explicitly suppresses git credential helpers for HTTP clone and `ls-remote` operations so stored tokens from Keychain, Credential Manager, `gh auth`, or other helpers are not sent over plaintext HTTP.

For routing all dependency traffic through an enterprise proxy (Artifactory or compatible), see [Registry Proxy & Air-gapped](./registry-proxy/).

## Content scanning

### The threat

Researchers have found hidden Unicode characters embedded in popular shared rules files. Tag characters (U+E0001–E007F) map 1:1 to invisible ASCII. Bidirectional overrides can reorder visible text. Zero-width joiners create invisible gaps. Variation selectors attach to visible characters, embedding invisible payload bytes that AST-based tools cannot detect. The Glassworm campaign (2026) exploited this mechanism to compromise repositories and VS Code extensions. LLMs tokenize all of these individually, meaning models process instructions that developers cannot see on screen.

### What APM detects

| Severity | Characters | Risk |
|----------|-----------|------|
| Critical | Tag characters (U+E0001–E007F), bidi overrides (U+202A–E, U+2066–9) | Hidden instruction embedding. Zero legitimate use in prompt files. |
| Critical | Variation selectors 17–256 (U+E0100–E01EF) | Glassworm attack vector — invisible payload encoding. Zero legitimate use in prompt files. |
| Warning | Zero-width spaces/joiners (U+200B–D), mid-file BOM (U+FEFF) | Common copy-paste debris, but can hide content. ZWJ inside emoji sequences is downgraded to info. |
| Warning | Variation selectors 1–15 (U+FE00–FE0E) | CJK typography / text presentation selectors. Uncommon in prompt files. |
| Warning | Bidi marks (U+200E–F, U+061C) | Invisible directional marks. No legitimate use in prompt files. |
| Warning | Invisible operators (U+2061–4) | Zero-width math operators. No legitimate use in prompt files. |
| Warning | Annotation markers (U+FFF9–B) | Interlinear annotation delimiters that can hide text. |
| Warning | Deprecated formatting (U+206A–F) | Deprecated since Unicode 3.0, invisible. |
| Info | Non-breaking spaces (U+00A0), unusual whitespace (U+2000–200A) | Mostly harmless, flagged for awareness. |
| Info | Emoji presentation selector (U+FE0F) | Common with emoji, informational only. |

### Pre-deployment gate

During `apm install`, source files in `apm_modules/` are scanned **before** any integrator copies them to target directories:

```
download → scan source → block or deploy → report
```

- **Critical findings block deployment.** The package is downloaded and cached so you can inspect it (`apm_modules/owner/package/`), but nothing reaches agent-readable directories.
- **Warnings are non-blocking.** Zero-width characters are flagged in the diagnostics summary. Files are deployed normally.
- **`--force` overrides the block.** Consistent with existing collision semantics — an explicit "I know what I'm doing."
- **Multi-package installs continue.** A blocked package doesn't stop other packages from installing. After all packages are processed, `apm install` exits with code 1 if any package was blocked — failing the CI step.

### Compile and pack scanning

Content scanning extends beyond install:

- **`apm compile`** scans compiled output (AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, commands) before writing to disk. Critical findings cause `apm compile` to exit with code 1 after writing — defense-in-depth since source files were already scanned at install, but compilation assembles content from multiple sources. `.github/copilot-instructions.md` is assembled from global instructions in `.apm/instructions/`, including those installed under `apm_modules/`.
- **`apm compile --global`** scans user-scope root context files assembled from
  globally installed instructions before writing them. Critical findings stop
  the write and exit with code 1. Existing hand-authored root context files are
  skipped unless they carry APM's generated marker, so opting into global
  compilation does not clobber user-managed `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, or
  `GEMINI.md` files.
- **`apm pack`** scans files before bundling. This catches hidden characters before a package is published, preventing authors from accidentally distributing tainted content.
- **`apm unpack`** scans bundle contents before deployment. This is a pre-deployment gate matching `apm install` — critical findings block deployment unless `--force` is used. (Note: `apm unpack` is DEPRECATED; prefer `apm install <bundle-path>` for new pipelines -- it applies the same scan plus lockfile integration. See [Pack and distribute](../producer/pack-a-bundle/).)

### On-demand scanning

`apm audit` scans deployed files or any arbitrary file, independent of the install flow:

```bash
apm audit                        # Scan all installed packages
apm audit --file .cursorrules    # Scan any file
apm audit --strip                # Remove hidden characters (preserves emoji)
apm audit --strip --dry-run      # Preview what --strip would remove
```

The `--file` flag is useful for inspecting files obtained outside APM — downloaded rules files, copy-pasted instructions, or files from pull requests.

For CI pipelines, `apm audit` supports SARIF, JSON, and Markdown output:

```bash
apm audit -f sarif -o audit.sarif      # GitHub Code Scanning
apm audit -f json -o report.json       # Machine-readable
apm audit -f markdown -o report.md     # Step summaries
```

See [Content scanning with `apm audit`](../reference/cli/audit/) for usage details and exit codes.

:::tip[External scanners (Experimental)]
`apm audit` can also ingest findings from **third-party SARIF scanners** (Semgrep, CodeQL, NVIDIA SkillSpector, etc.) so a single audit run reports both APM's native findings and external tool results. See [External scanners](../integrations/external-scanners/) for setup.
:::

### Limitations

Content scanning detects hidden Unicode characters. It does not detect:

- Plain-text prompt injection (visible but malicious instructions)
- Homoglyph substitution (visually similar characters from different scripts)
- Semantic manipulation (subtly misleading but syntactically normal text)
- Binary payload embedding

`--strip` removes dangerous and suspicious characters (critical and warning) from deployed copies while preserving legitimate content like emoji and whitespace. Zero-width joiners inside emoji sequences (e.g. 👨‍👩‍👧) are recognized and preserved. Use `--strip --dry-run` to preview what would be removed before modifying files. Strip does not modify the source package — the next `apm install` restores them. For persistent remediation, fix the upstream package or pin to a clean commit.

### Planned hardening

- **Hook transparency** — display hook script contents during install so developers can review what will execute.

### External scanner hardening

The experimental `external-scanners` feature can invoke a third-party SARIF scanner and optionally run its LLM-powered analysis -- a subprocess plus network-egress surface, hardened as follows:

- **Allowlisted args only.** `--external-args` tokens are validated against a per-adapter allowlist. Non-allowlisted flags, secret-looking flags (`--token`, `--api-key`), or paths outside the working directory are rejected fail-closed; argv is always a list (no `shell=True`).
- **Restrict-only policy.** A project `apm-policy.yml` can `allow_args: false` to strip args but can never add argv tokens nor force LLM mode on. Only the local user opts into LLM egress.
- **Credential hygiene.** LLM API keys are forwarded only when LLM mode is active for that run and stripped otherwise; scanner stderr is secret-redacted before surfacing.
- **Project-vs-org trust boundary.** LLM mode sends content to a third-party API, so it requires explicit user consent and is never triggered by an untrusted project-local policy file.

## Policy gates that block install

`apm-policy.yml` is evaluated before any download or write. The install preflight walks the resolved dependency graph -- including transitive MCP servers -- and fails the install if a dep is not in the allow list, falls under a deny rule, uses a forbidden source/scope, or violates a configured trust rule. In CI, `apm audit --ci` runs the same baseline plus policy checks (allow/deny lists, target restrictions, MCP transport restrictions). Tighten-only inheritance (enterprise -> org -> repo) is enforced so a downstream layer can never loosen an upstream rule. See [Get started with apm-policy.yml](./apm-policy/) and [Policy Reference](./policy-reference/).

## Content integrity hashing

APM computes a SHA-256 hash of each downloaded package's file tree and stores it in `apm.lock.yaml` as `content_hash`. On subsequent installs, cached packages under `apm_modules/` are verified against the lockfile hash. When the on-disk tree no longer matches, APM logs a warning and re-downloads. If freshly downloaded content still does not match the lockfile record, the install **aborts** (possible supply-chain tampering). Use `apm install --update` to accept new upstream content and refresh the lockfile.

```yaml
# apm.lock.yaml
dependencies:
  - repo_url: https://github.com/acme-corp/security-baseline
    resolved_commit: a1b2c3d4e5f6a7b8c9d0e1f234567890abcdef12
    content_hash: "sha256:9f86d081884c7d659a2feaa0c55ad015..."
```

The hash is deterministic — computed over sorted file paths and contents, independent of filesystem metadata (timestamps, permissions). `.git/` and `__pycache__/` directories are excluded.

Lock files generated before this feature omit `content_hash`. APM handles this gracefully — verification is skipped and the hash is populated on the next install.

On every cache hit, APM reads the cached checkout's `.git/HEAD` directly (not via `git rev-parse`, so a poisoned `.git/config` cannot subvert the check) and compares it to the lockfile's `resolved_commit`; on mismatch the cache entry is evicted and a fresh fetch runs. Local bundles get a fourth check: every file listed in `pack.bundle_files` is SHA-256 verified, symlinks under the bundle root are rejected, and unlisted files are flagged as a tampering signal.

See the [Lock File Specification](../reference/lockfile-spec/#44-content-integrity) for field details.

## Inventory export (SBOM)

`apm lock export --format cyclonedx|spdx` serializes the lockfile into a CycloneDX 1.5 or SPDX 2.3 document. This is an inventory export, not a security attestation: it reflects exactly what `apm.lock.yaml` already recorded -- component identity (purl), recorded hashes, and the declared license -- and never re-resolves, re-hashes, or touches the network or filesystem.

Component identity is a Package URL: `pkg:github/<owner>/<repo>@<commit>` for git deps, `pkg:oci/<name>@<digest>` for registry deps, and `pkg:generic/<name>@<content_hash>` for local primitives. Output is deterministic (components sorted by purl, pinned timestamp, stable key order), so two runs are byte-identical. Credentials embedded in a recorded URL (userinfo or query-string tokens) are scrubbed before they reach the document.

APM records the license the package manifest *declares* (`license:` in `apm.yml`), validates it offline against the bundled SPDX id set, and passes it through. APM never reads or interprets `LICENSE` file text -- declared is not concluded. A not-declared license stays unknown (`NOASSERTION`), never silently upgraded. See [`apm lock export`](../reference/cli/lock/#export-sbom-inventory) and the [`license` manifest field](../reference/manifest-schema/#35-license) for reference.

## Path security

APM deploys files only to controlled subdirectories within the project root.

### Path traversal prevention

All deploy paths are validated before any file operation:

1. **No `..` segments.** Any path containing `..` is rejected outright.
2. **Allowed prefixes only.** Paths must start with an allowed target-integrator prefix (`.github/`, `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, `.opencode/`, `.codex/`, `.gemini/`, `.windsurf/`, `.kiro/`, `.agents/`). In addition, the local-bundle install path stages instructions for compile-only targets under `apm_modules/<slug>/.apm/instructions/` with its own containment check (the resolved path must remain within `apm_modules/`) and `<slug>` validation rejecting traversal sequences and characters outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`.
3. **Resolution containment.** The fully resolved path must remain within the project root directory.

A path must pass all three checks. Failure on any check prevents the file from being written.

### Local bundle install trust model

`apm install <bundle>` accepts a directory or `.zip` (or legacy `.tar.gz`) produced by `apm pack`. Bundles are imperative (no policy / dependency-resolver / network) and target-agnostic; the consumer's project drives where files land. Trust boundaries:

1. **`bundle_files` keys are untrusted.** They come from the bundle's own `apm.lock.yaml` and are validated for traversal sequences before any filesystem path is constructed; resolved destinations must remain within the deploy root. Unsafe entries are skipped with a warning.
2. **`plugin.json` is bundle metadata, never deployed.** It is recognized case-insensitively and skipped in both the manifest-driven deploy loop and the lockfile-less fallback walk so case-folding filesystems (HFS+, NTFS) cannot smuggle a renamed file past the skip.
3. **`.mcp.json` is bundle metadata, never deployed verbatim.** It is recognized case-insensitively and skipped from the deploy loop. After files deploy, `apm install` parses the bundle's `.mcp.json` (Anthropic plugin schema, `mcpServers` map) and routes each entry through `MCPIntegrator.install` as a self-defined dependency, so the consumer's resolved target(s) get the servers in their own native MCP config (Claude `.mcp.json`, Copilot `~/.copilot/mcp-config.json`, VS Code `.vscode/mcp.json`, Cursor `.cursor/mcp.json`, etc.). `MCPIntegrator` enforces the same validation and runtime gating used by `apm.yml`-declared servers; per-server parse errors are isolated and do not block the rest of the install.
4. **Slug validation.** The bundle's `id` (used as `<slug>` for staged instructions and the install label) is rejected if it contains traversal sequences or characters outside `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`.

### Symlink handling

Symlinks are rejected in most APM operations; the only context where in-package
symlinks are followed is local-path install, under a per-symlink containment
check (see below):

- **Primitive discovery** (instructions, agents, prompts, contexts, skills) rejects symlinked files during glob-based file enumeration. Symlinks are silently skipped.
- **Prompt resolution** (`apm preview`, `apm run`) rejects symlinked `.prompt.md` files with an explicit error message.
- **Integrator file discovery** (agents, instructions, prompts, skills, hooks) rejects symlinked files via `is_symlink()` checks in `find_files_by_glob` and `find_hook_files`.
- **Deploy tree copy operations** skip symlinks entirely -- they are excluded from the copy via an ignore filter.
- **MCP configuration files** that are symlinks are rejected with a warning and not parsed.
- **Manifest parsing** requires files to pass both `.is_file()` and `not .is_symlink()` checks.
- **Manifest integrity** -- a malformed `apm.yml` (invalid YAML or non-mapping content) triggers a failing `manifest-parse` audit check. Policy and baseline CI checks never silently pass when the manifest cannot be parsed. If this check fires, fix the YAML syntax error in your `apm.yml` and re-run the audit.
- **Archive creation** -- `apm pack` excludes symlinks from bundled archives. Packaged artifacts contain no symbolic links, preventing symlink-based escape attacks in distributed bundles.

#### Local-install symlink dereference and containment guarantee

When installing a local-path dependency (`apm install /path/to/pkg`), APM
dereferences in-package symlinks so that the staged copy in `apm_modules/`
contains regular files, giving local and remote installs the same deployed
output for in-package shared references.

**Threat model.** A symlink inside a local package could point to a file
outside the package root, giving a malicious package a path-traversal vector.
APM prevents this with a per-symlink containment check (see also
[Path traversal prevention](#path-traversal-prevention)):

1. Each symlink is resolved per-file (resolve -> validate -> copy2) before that
   symlink target is copied into the staging tree.
2. The resolved target is verified to remain inside the package root using
   the `ensure_path_within()` containment helper.
3. If a symlink is broken or unresolvable, APM **hard-fails the install** with a
   `PathTraversalError` instead of staging a dangling reference.
4. If the resolved target escapes the package root, APM **hard-fails the
   install** with a `PathTraversalError` and a human-readable message naming
   the offending link. No warn-and-skip; no silent follow.
5. Only symlinks that resolve within the package root are dereferenced and
   copied as regular files. External symlinks are never followed.
6. Circular directory-symlink chains are detected deterministically with an
   explicit visited-set guard, independent of OS-level ELOOP limits.
7. An unreadable package directory (e.g. a `PermissionError` while listing its
   entries) hard-fails the install with a `PathTraversalError` rather than
   leaking a bare OS error up the install stack.

### Collision detection

When APM deploys a file, it checks whether a file already exists at the target path:

- If the file is **tracked in the managed files set** (deployed by a previous APM install), it is overwritten.
- If the file is **not tracked** (user-authored or created by another tool), APM skips it and prints a warning.
- The `--force` flag overrides collision detection, allowing APM to overwrite untracked files.

### Development dependency isolation

APM separates production and development dependencies:

- **Production dependencies** (`dependencies.apm`) are included in plugin bundles and shared packages.
- **Development dependencies** (`devDependencies.apm`, installed via `apm install --dev`) are resolved and cached locally but **excluded** from `apm pack` output (both plugin format -- the default -- and `--format apm`).

This prevents transitive inclusion of development-only packages (test fixtures, linting rules, internal helpers) in distributed artifacts. The lockfile marks dev dependencies with `is_dev: true` for explicit tracking. See the [Lock File Specification](../reference/lockfile-spec/#42-dependency-entries) for field details.

## Slash command deployment

Several IDE-style targets read files in their `commands/` directory as
**slash commands** -- typing `/foo` in the IDE invokes the file's
content as an LLM prompt with full tool access. Across all supported
targets (Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Gemini CLI), invocation
requires the user to type the command name; commands are not
auto-invoked at IDE startup or on disk-write.

`apm install` deploys package `.prompt.md` files to each target's
commands directory by default when that directory exists, so packaged
slash commands are available to the user immediately and consistently
across targets.

| Target | Commands directory | Notes |
|--------|--------------------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | `.claude/commands/*.md` | Deployed when `.claude/` exists. |
| **Cursor** | `.cursor/commands/*.md` | Deployed when `.cursor/` exists. Cursor 1.6+ only; Cursor is de-emphasizing commands in favor of rules/skills -- monitor [Cursor release notes](https://cursor.com/changelog) for changes. The shared command transformer keeps the Claude-compatible frontmatter subset (`description`, `allowed-tools`, `model`, `argument-hint`, `input`); Cursor-specific keys (`author`, `mcp`, `parameters`, ...) are dropped with an install-time warning per file. |
| **OpenCode** | `.opencode/commands/*.md` | Deployed when `.opencode/` exists. |
| **Gemini CLI** | `.gemini/commands/*.toml` | Deployed when `.gemini/` exists. |

## Executable trust gate

APM blocks executable primitives from dependency packages by default: hooks,
`bin/` executables, self-defined MCP servers (`registry: false`), and canvas
extensions. Text primitives (skills, agents, instructions) are never gated, and
local root `.apm/` content is always trusted.

Trust is expressed through one noun, `executables`, across three layers, and the
install gate and `apm audit` resolve it through a single deny-wins,
first-match-wins ladder:

```
1. org deny_all / org deny   -> denied (absolute ceiling)
2. user deny                 -> denied
3. project deny              -> denied
4. project allow             -> allowed
5. user allow                -> allowed
6. org recommend             -> allowed (user-overridable)
7. (no match)                -> gated pending approval (denied but approvable)
```

- **Org** (`apm-policy.yml` `executables:`) is the ceiling on deny. It can
  `deny_all`, `deny` packages, `require` packages be present and trusted, and
  `recommend` a vetted set. See [executables](../reference/policy-schema/#executables) in the policy
  schema.
- **Project** (`apm.yml` `executables.{allow,deny}`) is committed admin trust,
  shared with the team.
- **User** (`~/.apm/config.json` `executables.{allow,deny}`) is the lowest
  authority -- a machine-local override that can only narrow, never widen past
  an org or project deny.

Personal consent can never widen past an org deny, and the default (rung 7) is
**gated pending approval** -- a package with executables and no opinion anywhere
is parked until approved, not hard-denied. This release ships no `enforce`
mandate runtime, no signing, and no content-hash binding; an org
`executables.enforce` rung degrades to `recommend`.

Each locked dependency records its resolved state in the `exec_status` field of
`apm.lock.yaml` (`deployed`, `gated_pending_approval`, `denied`, or `absent`).
For CI, `apm install` succeeds when a required package is present-but-parked and
prints a one-command remedy (e.g. `apm approve <pkg>`); a separate audit signal,
`required-executable-untrusted`, hard-fails when a required package's
executables are untrusted. Manage trust with [`apm approve` / `apm
deny`](../reference/cli/approve/), inspect the deciding layer for one
package with `apm policy explain <pkg>`, and surface fleet-wide layer
conflicts with `apm doctor`.

## MCP server trust model

APM integrates MCP (Model Context Protocol) server configurations from packages. Trust is explicit and scoped by dependency depth.

### Direct dependencies

MCP servers declared by your direct dependencies (packages listed in your `apm.yml`) are auto-trusted. You explicitly chose to depend on these packages, so their MCP server declarations are accepted.

### Transitive dependencies

MCP servers declared by transitive dependencies (dependencies of your dependencies) are **blocked by default**. Transitive MCP servers can request tool access, file system permissions, or network capabilities — blocking them ensures that adding a prompt package cannot silently grant MCP access to an unknown transitive dependency.

To allow transitive MCP servers, you must either:

- **Re-declare the dependency** in your own `apm.yml`, promoting it to a direct dependency.
- **Pass `--trust-transitive-mcp`** to explicitly opt in to transitive MCP servers for that install.

## Token handling

APM authenticates to git hosts using personal access tokens (PATs) read from environment variables.

| Purpose | Environment variables (checked in order) |
|---|---|
| GitHub packages | `GITHUB_APM_PAT`, `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN` |
| Azure DevOps packages | `ADO_APM_PAT` |

- **Never stored in files.** Tokens are read from the environment at runtime. They are never written to `apm.yml`, `apm.lock.yaml`, or any generated file.
- **Never logged.** Token values are not included in console output, error messages, or debug logs.
- **Scoped to their git host and server identity.** A GitHub token is only sent when both the server name is on the GitHub allowlist and the remote URL hostname is a verified GitHub/Copilot host (`github.com`, `*.ghe.com`, `*.github.com`, `githubcopilot.com`, `*.githubcopilot.com`). HTTPS is required -- `http://` URLs are rejected even when the hostname matches. An Azure DevOps token is only sent to Azure DevOps. Tokens are never transmitted to any other endpoint.
- **Injected via transient git config.** APM passes credentials with `http.extraheader` for the duration of a single git invocation; tokens are never embedded in URLs and are not visible in `ps` or process listings.

For GitHub, a fine-grained PAT with read-only `Contents` permission on the repositories you depend on is sufficient.

### Azure DevOps AAD bearer tokens

When `ADO_APM_PAT` is unset, APM can authenticate to Azure DevOps with a Microsoft Entra ID bearer token issued on demand by the Azure CLI (`az account get-access-token`). The posture:

- **Short-lived.** Tokens expire in roughly 60 minutes, are acquired per resolution, and are never persisted by APM.
- **No new secrets in manifests.** Nothing is written to `apm.yml` or `apm.lock.yaml`. The token never crosses the `apm.yml`/lockfile boundary.
- **Compatible with managed-identity / service-account-only orgs.** Works in environments where PAT creation is disabled, including WIF-backed pipelines.
- **Same transport rules as PATs.** Bearer values are injected via `http.extraheader`, scoped to ADO hosts only, and never logged.

See [Azure DevOps AAD bearer tokens](#azure-devops-aad-bearer-tokens) above for the resolution precedence and CI patterns.

## Attack surface comparison

| Vector | Traditional package manager | APM |
|---|---|---|
| Registry compromise | Attacker poisons central registry | No registry by default (git-direct). With experimental `registries`: `resolved_hash` detects tampered archives; token containment enforced; package signing not yet supported. |
| Version substitution | Malicious version replaces legitimate one | Lock file pins exact commit SHA; content hash detects post-download tampering |
| Post-install scripts | Arbitrary code runs after install | No code execution |
| Typosquatting | Similar package names on registry | Dependencies are full git URLs |
| Build-time injection | Malicious build steps execute | No build step — files are copied |
| Hidden content injection | Not applicable (binary packages) | Pre-deploy scan blocks critical hidden Unicode; `apm audit` for on-demand checks |
| Compromised policy intermediary | Not applicable (no policy layer) | A malicious mirror or MITM returns valid YAML with relaxed rules. Mitigated by [`policy.hash` consumer-side pin](./policy-reference/#96-hash-pin-policyhash-consumer-side-verification) which verifies raw bytes against a project-pinned digest. |

## Recommended hardening

For an org standardizing on APM:

- Require `GITHUB_APM_PAT` / `ADO_APM_PAT` from a secret store, never developer dotfiles; scope tokens read-only on source repos.
- Wire `apm audit --ci -f sarif -o audit.sarif` into branch protection and upload SARIF to GitHub code scanning.
- Publish an `apm-policy.yml` from your `<org>/.github` repo with an allow list and an MCP transport restriction. See [Governance Guide](./governance-guide/).
- Require signed commits on the source repos APM pulls from -- this is where the trust chain bottoms out.
- Route dep traffic through an enterprise proxy with audit logging. See [Registry Proxy & Air-gapped](./registry-proxy/).
- Forbid `allow_insecure: true` via the policy allow list, except where an air-gapped mirror demands it.
- Scan committed `apm.yml` for literal secrets in `mcp.env` values -- APM assumes env-var indirection (`GITHUB_TOKEN: ${GITHUB_TOKEN}`) but does not enforce it. `apm install` auto-adds `apm_modules/` to `.gitignore`, keeping cached source trees out of commits.

## Frequently asked questions

### Can a package embed hidden instructions?

Not without detection. APM scans all package source files before deployment. Critical hidden characters (tag characters, bidi overrides) block deployment. `apm audit` provides on-demand scanning for any file, including those obtained outside APM.

### How do I audit what APM installed?

The `apm.lock.yaml` file records every dependency (with exact commit SHA) and every file deployed. It is a plain YAML file suitable for automated policy checks, diff review, and compliance tooling. See the [Governance Guide](./governance-guide/) for audit workflows.

### Is the APM binary signed?

APM is distributed as a PyPI package (`apm-cli`) and as pre-built binaries attached to GitHub Releases under the `microsoft` organization. Both distribution channels use GitHub Actions workflows with pinned dependencies and are auditable through the public repository.

### Where is the source code?

APM is open source under the MIT license, hosted on GitHub under the `microsoft` organization. The full source code, build pipeline, and release process are publicly auditable.
