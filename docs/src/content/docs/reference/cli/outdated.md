Compare locked dependencies against their remotes to see what has new versions available. Read-only: this command does not modify `apm.lock.yaml` or touch `apm_modules/`.

## Synopsis

```bash
apm outdated [OPTIONS]
```

## Description

`apm outdated` reads `apm.lock.yaml` and queries each remote to detect staleness:

- **Plain tag-pinned deps** (e.g. `v1.2.3` or `1.2.3`): semver compare against the latest matching remote tag.
- **Patterned tag-pinned deps** (e.g. `my-pkg_v1.2.3`, `my-pkg--v1.2.3`, or `my-pkg-v1.2.3`): semver compare against the latest tag matching the package-specific pattern inferred from the locked ref. For virtual subdirectory packages (installed via `path:` in `apm.yml`), `{name}` is derived from the final path segment, so a dep with `path: packages/my-pkg` resolves tags like `my-pkg_v1.2.3`.
- **Full-SHA revision-pinned deps**: compare the pinned SHA against the commit behind the latest annotated semver tag. Branches and lightweight tags are ignored.
- **Branch-pinned deps** (e.g. `main`): compare the locked commit SHA against the remote branch tip.
- **Default-branch deps** (no ref): compare against `main`/`master` tip.
- **Marketplace deps**: compare the installed ref against the marketplace entry's current `source.ref`.
- **Registry deps** (experimental `registries` feature): compare the lockfile's exact `version` against the highest semver on the registry that satisfies the manifest range (same resolution semantics as `apm install`). Manifest ranges come from the root `apm.yml` and from installed packages' `apm.yml` files (transitive deps). When a registry lockfile entry has no manifest range, `apm outdated` compares against the highest published version and labels the source `(lockfile)`.

Common monorepo layouts are detected automatically for `outdated` reporting. Set an explicit marketplace `tag_pattern` when your producer uses a different layout than the built-in patterns.

Local dependencies and Artifactory-hosted deps are skipped. Legacy `apm.lock` files are migrated to `apm.lock.yaml` automatically on read.

To apply the suggested updates, run `apm install --update` (see [Related](#related)).

## Options

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `-g, --global` | Check user-scope dependencies in `~/.apm/` instead of the current project. |
| `-v, --verbose` | For outdated tag-pinned or registry deps, also list up to 10 newer available versions/tags. |
| `-j, --parallel-checks N` | Max concurrent remote checks. Default `4`. `0` forces sequential. |

## Examples

Check project dependencies:

```bash
apm outdated
```

Sample output:

  [!] 7 outdated dependencies found
```

Check user-scope deps installed under `~/.apm/`:

```bash
apm outdated --global
```

Full-SHA pins use the annotated-tag update rules described in [`apm update`](../update/).

Show available tags for outdated packages:

```bash
apm outdated --verbose
```

### Monorepo subdirectory packages

Monorepo dependency installed via `path:`:

```yaml
# apm.yml
- git: https://github.com/org/monorepo.git
  path: packages/my-pkg
  ref: my-pkg_v1.0.0
```

`apm.lock.yaml` records the resolved commit SHA at lock time; the tag ref drives
`outdated` detection only and is not the integrity pin.

With a newer tag `my-pkg_v1.1.0` on the remote, `apm outdated` reports it as outdated.

Use 8 parallel checks for large dependency sets:

```bash
apm outdated -j 8
```

### Status values

| Status | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `up-to-date` | Locked ref matches the remote. |
| `outdated` | A newer tag, branch tip SHA, or registry version in the manifest range is available. |
| `unknown` | The remote could not be queried, or the ref could not be resolved. For registry deps, also check auth (`APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_{NAME}`) and that the registry URL is configured. |

Registry `Source` values:

| Source pattern | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `registry: NAME` | Compared using the manifest semver range from `apm.yml` (root or an installed package). |
| `registry: NAME (lockfile)` | No manifest range found; compared against the highest published version on the registry. |
| `registry (pinned ref)` | Manifest carries a non-semver selector (e.g. `main`, `stable`, `v1.4.2`); the dep is exact-matched at install time. `apm outdated` reports `unknown` status since a pinned label is not a range and no higher version can be inferred. Previously, such deps reported perpetual `outdated`; this was a bug (the locked version always differed from a range comparison result). |
| `registry (no version selector)` | Manifest dep has no `#<version>` selector; `apm install` rejects it. |
| `registry (invalid manifest range)` | Manifest carries a malformed semver range (e.g. `^1.0` missing patch); `apm install` rejects it. |

## Exit codes

| Code | Condition |
|---|---|
| `0` | Check completed (including when outdated deps are reported). |
| `1` | No lockfile found in the selected scope. |

`apm outdated` is a reporting command. Finding outdated deps is not an error and does not change the exit code; wire `apm audit` into CI instead if you want gating.
