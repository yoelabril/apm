This document is the wire-level contract. It is self-contained — a server implementer should be able to build a conformant registry from this doc alone. For the client side and how to declare registries in `apm.yml`, see the [Registries guide](../../guides/registries/).

::::caution[Experimental client support]
The HTTP API contract is implementable, but APM client consumption of package registries is currently behind an experimental flag. Users must run `apm experimental enable registries` before installing from `registries:` entries.

## 1. Conventions

### 1.1 Base URL

The registry's **base URL** is vendor-defined — for example, `https://registry.example.com/apm`. Clients always append paths starting with `/v1/...` to it. The base URL MUST NOT contain a trailing slash; if vendors return one in their UI, the client strips it (see `RegistryClient.__init__`).

### 1.2 Identity

`{owner}/{repo}` in path segments matches `DependencyReference.get_identity()` for GitHub-origin packages. For non-GitHub origins, identity is **percent-encoded** (each `/` in the identity becomes `%2F`):

| Origin | Identity | Path segment |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub | `acme/web-skills` | `acme/web-skills` (two segments) |
| GitLab | `gitlab.com/acme/web-skills` | `gitlab.com%2Facme%2Fweb-skills` (one encoded segment) |
| Azure DevOps | `dev.azure.com/org/proj/repo` | `dev.azure.com%2Forg%2Fproj%2Frepo` (one encoded segment) |

Servers MUST decode percent-encoded path segments before lookup.

### 1.3 Versions

Version strings are opaque, case-sensitive selectors. Servers MAY use
[semver 2.0](https://semver.org/) strings when they want clients to support
range selection (`^1.2.3`, `>=1.2.0 <2.0.0`), but semver is optional so
registries can mirror existing Git flows (`main`, `stable`, `v1.2.3`, commit
pins, or other enterprise naming conventions).

Clients interpret semver-looking selectors as ranges. Non-semver selectors are
matched exactly against the `version` values returned by `/versions`.

### 1.3.1 Field naming convention

All JSON field names use **`snake_case`** (matches npm, Cargo, PyPI conventions). Servers MUST NOT emit camelCase variants alongside or instead of the canonical names.

The reference client is intentionally **strict** — it reads only the spec-canonical field name and ignores camelCase variants without raising. This is by design: silent client tolerance hides server spec drift. A server emitting `publishedAt` instead of `published_at` is non-conformant and clients SHOULD treat its absence as if the field were not provided.

### 1.4 Content types

| Resource | Type |
|---|---|
| List versions, problem details, publish response | `application/json; charset=utf-8` |
| RFC 7807 problem detail | `application/problem+json; charset=utf-8` |
| Archive download (gzip) | `application/gzip` |
| Archive download (zip) | `application/zip` |

Servers SHOULD set `charset=utf-8` on JSON responses but clients MUST NOT depend on it.

### 1.5 Versioning the API itself

The leading `/v1/` path segment is the API version. Future breaking changes ship under `/v2/`. Servers SHOULD support multiple versions in parallel during migration.

### 1.6 Idempotency and immutability

- **Versions are immutable.** A successful `PUT .../versions/{version}` cannot be overwritten — subsequent PUTs return `409 Conflict`. This is a hard requirement; clients depend on it for the lockfile trust model.
- **List queries are idempotent.** `GET /versions` MUST return the same set of versions on identical inputs.


---

## 2. Authentication

### 2.1 Bearer token

Every endpoint accepts `Authorization: Bearer <token>`. Tokens are opaque strings issued by the registry; the client treats them as bytes (no parsing, no inspection).

When the header is absent, the server MAY:
- accept the request (anonymous read on a public registry), OR
- reject with `401 Unauthorized` (authenticated reads only).

Clients try anonymous first when no env var is configured for a URL (per design §6.2). Servers SHOULD return `401` rather than `403` for missing-credential cases so clients can distinguish "auth required" from "auth provided but not authorized."

### 2.1.1 HTTP Basic auth (alternative)

Servers MAY accept `Authorization: Basic <base64(username:password)>` as a v1 alternative to Bearer. This is a first-class option for compatibility with enterprise registries that already support Basic and where Bearer-token issuance from end-user credentials is a separate, registry-specific flow.

Servers MUST treat both forms as semantically identical for scope evaluation: a Basic-authed `admin:password` request and a Bearer-authed equivalent token MUST produce the same scope grants.

Clients that support Basic auth read credentials from `APM_REGISTRY_USER_{NAME}` + `APM_REGISTRY_PASS_{NAME}` environment variables (see §2.3). When both Bearer and Basic env vars are set for the same registry, clients send Bearer.

### 2.2 Scopes (server-side enforcement)

Tokens MUST carry one or more of these scopes. Clients never see scope strings — the server enforces them on each request.

| Scope | Required for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `read` | `GET /versions`, `GET /download` | Coarse read access |
| `read:{owner}/{repo}` | Same as `read` but scoped | Optional fine-grained variant |
| `publish:{owner}/{repo}` | `PUT .../versions/{version}` | Per-package publish authority |
| `publish:{owner}/*` | Same, all repos under owner | Convenience wildcard |

Servers MUST reject mismatched-scope requests with `403 Forbidden` and an RFC 7807 body citing which scope is missing.

### 2.3 Client env-var conventions

Clients use the following environment variables, where `{NAME}` is the uppercased registry name with `-` and `.` mapped to `_`:

| Env var | Auth method |
|---|---|
| `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_{NAME}` | `Authorization: Bearer <value>` |
| `APM_REGISTRY_USER_{NAME}` + `APM_REGISTRY_PASS_{NAME}` | `Authorization: Basic <base64(user:pass)>` |

When both are set, Bearer wins. When neither is set, the client tries the request anonymously and falls back to a clear remediation message on 401/403.

The prefix is distinct from `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_APM_PAT`, `PROXY_REGISTRY_*`, and `ARTIFACTORY_APM_TOKEN`. Servers don't see these — included here for protocol completeness.

---

## 3. Endpoints

### 3.1 `GET /v1/packages/{owner}/{repo}/versions` — list versions

Returns all published versions for a package.

**Request**

```
GET /v1/packages/acme/web-skills/versions HTTP/1.1
Host: registry.example.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accept: application/json
```

**Response 200**

```json
{
  "package": "acme/web-skills",
  "versions": [
    {
      "version": "1.2.0",
      "digest": "sha256:abc123...",
      "published_at": "2026-03-01T12:00:00Z",
      "size_bytes": 24576
    },
    {
      "version": "1.1.0",
      "digest": "sha256:def456...",
      "published_at": "2026-02-14T08:00:00Z",
      "size_bytes": 23000
    }
  ]
}
```

**Field requirements**

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `package` | yes | Echoes the requested identity. Useful for clients that fetched via percent-encoded path. |
| `versions[]` | yes | May be empty (`[]`); MUST NOT be omitted. |
| `versions[].version` | yes | Opaque version/ref selector. Semver strings enable client-side range matching; non-semver strings are matched exactly. |
| `versions[].digest` | yes | sha256 of the archive bytes. Format: `sha256:<64 lowercase hex chars>`. |
| `versions[].published_at` | yes | ISO 8601 UTC timestamp. |
| `versions[].size_bytes` | optional | Archive size; informational. |

**Ordering.** Servers SHOULD return versions in publish-time descending order (newest first). Clients MUST NOT depend on order. For semver range selectors, clients sort semver-compatible versions client-side; exact selectors do direct string matching.

**Errors**

| Status | Reason |
|---|---|
| `401` | Missing/invalid token, anonymous reads disabled |
| `403` | Token lacks `read` scope for this package |
| `404` | Package not found |

**Caching.** Versions are immutable, but the SET of versions changes when new releases ship. Servers SHOULD set `Cache-Control: max-age=60` (or shorter); clients MAY honor it.

---

### 3.2 `GET /v1/packages/{owner}/{repo}/versions/{version}/download` — download archive

Streams the immutable package archive. The endpoint is named `/download` (not `/tarball`) because both gzip and zip archives are valid responses; `Content-Type` discriminates.

**Request**

```
GET /v1/packages/acme/web-skills/versions/1.2.0/download HTTP/1.1
Host: registry.example.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Accept: application/gzip, application/zip
```

Clients SHOULD send the `Accept` header to advertise both formats. Servers SHOULD honor `Accept` if they store both, but MAY ignore it and return whatever was published.

**Response 200**

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/gzip          ← or application/zip
Content-Length: 24576
Digest: sha256=<base64-of-binary-digest>   (RFC 3230)
ETag: "sha256:abc123..."

<binary archive body>
```

**Required headers**

| Header | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `Content-Type` | yes | One of `application/gzip` or `application/zip`. |
| `Content-Length` | recommended | Streamed delivery is fine; if absent, clients buffer to memory. |
| `Digest` | recommended | RFC 3230 hash. Clients verify against `versions[].digest` from /versions, not this header. |
| `ETag` | optional | Conditional GET support; clients may use it for caching across runs. |

**Body.** Raw archive bytes. The same bytes that hash to the `digest` advertised in `/versions`.

**Format selection at publish time.** APM publishes via `apm pack` (tar.gz). Anthropic skills publish via standard zip. Servers store and return whatever was uploaded; format conversion is NOT a server responsibility.

**Errors**

| Status | Reason |
|---|---|
| `401`, `403` | Same semantics as 3.1 |
| `404` | No such (owner, repo, version) tuple |
| `410` | Version yanked (v2; reserved) |

**Hash verification on client.** Per design §6.1, clients re-hash the body against `versions[].digest` from a fresh `/versions` call OR from the lockfile's `resolved_hash`. A mismatch fails closed before extraction. Servers SHOULD NOT rely on this — they provide bytes; the trust gate is client-side.

---

### 3.3 `PUT /v1/packages/{owner}/{repo}/versions/{version}` — publish

Uploads a new version. Versions are immutable: re-publishing returns `409`.

**Request**

```
PUT /v1/packages/acme/web-skills/versions/1.2.0 HTTP/1.1
Host: registry.example.com
Authorization: Bearer <publish-token>
Content-Type: application/gzip
Content-Length: 24576

<binary archive body>
```

**Body.** Archive bytes — either tar.gz (`application/gzip`) or zip (`application/zip`). The server records the Content-Type and replays it on subsequent `GET /download`.

**Response 201**

```json
{
  "package": "acme/web-skills",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "digest": "sha256:abc123...",
  "published_at": "2026-03-01T12:00:00Z",
  "size_bytes": 24576
}
```

**Errors**

| Status | Reason |
|---|---|
| `400` | Malformed body (e.g. corrupt gzip, invalid zip directory). Body: RFC 7807 with `detail` describing the parse error. |
| `401`, `403` | Auth missing / scope mismatch |
| `409` | Version already exists. Body: RFC 7807 with `detail: "version 1.2.0 already published at 2026-02-14T08:00:00Z"`. |
| `413` | Body exceeds the registry's per-archive size limit. |
| `415` | `Content-Type` is neither `application/gzip` nor `application/zip`. |
| `422` | Server-side validation failed (see §6). Body lists validation errors in `extensions.errors[]`. |

Idempotency for `PUT` is **not** the standard "same request always succeeds" — it's "same `(owner, repo, version)` always returns 409 after the first success." This is the immutability invariant clients depend on for the lockfile trust model.

---

## 4. Error model

All `4xx` and `5xx` responses use **RFC 7807 Problem Details** in `application/problem+json`:

```json
{
  "type": "https://docs.apm.dev/errors/version-conflict",
  "title": "Version already published",
  "status": 409,
  "detail": "Version 1.2.0 of acme/web-skills was already published at 2026-02-14T08:00:00Z",
  "instance": "/v1/packages/acme/web-skills/versions/1.2.0",
  "extensions": {
    "previous_publish": "2026-02-14T08:00:00Z",
    "previous_digest": "sha256:..."
  }
}
```

**Required fields:** `title`, `status`. All others optional but recommended.

**Vendor extensions** belong under `extensions.*` per RFC 7807. Clients MUST ignore unknown extensions.

---

## 5. Conformance: required vs optional

A **conformant v1 server** MUST implement:

- `GET /v1/packages/{owner}/{repo}/versions`
- `GET /v1/packages/{owner}/{repo}/versions/{version}/download`
- `PUT /v1/packages/{owner}/{repo}/versions/{version}`
- RFC 7807 error bodies on all 4xx/5xx
- Bearer auth on all endpoints (anonymous reads optional)
- sha256 digest accuracy (the byte sequence served at `/download` MUST match the digest advertised at `/versions`)
- Version immutability (a successful PUT cannot be overwritten)

A **fully-featured v1 server** SHOULD additionally implement:

- `Cache-Control` and `ETag` on read endpoints
- Conditional `GET` (`If-None-Match`) returning `304`
- Per-version `size_bytes` field

Clients MUST NOT crash on missing optional fields; they MUST parse `versions[]` even with no `published_at`.

---

## 6. Server validation rules (publish)

On `PUT .../versions/{version}`, the server MUST validate (returning `422` on failure with errors in `extensions.errors[]`):

1. **Version is a non-empty opaque selector** after URL decoding. Reject control characters and empty strings; do not treat the selector as a filesystem path.
2. **Archive parses cleanly** as the declared `Content-Type` (gzip or zip).
3. **Archive contains an `apm.yml` at the root** of the extraction tree.
4. **`apm.yml` is valid YAML** with required fields (`name`, `version`).
5. **`apm.yml.version` is present**. Servers MAY require it to match the URL path version when their registry policy wants manifest/version lockstep.
6. **`apm.yml.name` matches the URL path identity** (or its repo-name suffix — implementation-defined).
7. **Archive entries are safe** — no absolute paths, no `..` traversal, no symlinks/hardlinks.
8. **Archive size is within limits** — vendor-defined; suggested default 50 MB.

**Out of scope for v1:**

- License-text validation
- Vulnerability scanning (servers MAY block but it's not required by the spec)
- Signature verification (deferred to v2)

---

## 7. Caching, rate limiting, and headers

### 7.1 Caching

| Endpoint | Recommended `Cache-Control` |
|---|---|
| `GET /versions` | `max-age=60, public` |
| `GET /download` | `max-age=86400, immutable` (versions are immutable) |


Clients MAY ignore these. APM v1 client does no HTTP caching.

### 7.2 Rate limiting

Servers SHOULD return `429 Too Many Requests` with a `Retry-After` header (seconds) when limits are exceeded. The body SHOULD be RFC 7807 with `extensions.limit` and `extensions.remaining`.

### 7.3 Required response headers

`Content-Type` is always required. Other headers are recommended but optional.

---

## 8. Security checklist

For server implementers:

- [ ] **TLS only.** Plain HTTP MUST NOT be supported in production. (Local dev is fine.)
- [ ] **Token storage.** Use a one-way hash (bcrypt/argon2) for stored bearer tokens; never store plaintext.
- [ ] **Path traversal prevention.** Reject `..` segments in `{owner}` and `{repo}` path params before any storage lookup; store `{version}` as an opaque key rather than a filesystem path.
- [ ] **Archive scanning at publish.** Validate per §6 before persistence; reject zip slip / symlink attacks.
- [ ] **Constant-time digest comparison.** When comparing a client-provided digest (e.g. for conditional GET) to the stored value.
- [ ] **Audit log.** Record every successful `PUT` with (token-id, owner/repo, version, sha256, timestamp).
- [ ] **Quota enforcement.** Per-token / per-owner archive size and count limits.

For client implementers (informational):

- [ ] Verify sha256 against `versions[].digest` before extraction.
- [ ] Reject `..`, absolute paths, symlinks, and hardlinks during extraction.
- [ ] Persist `resolved_url` in the lockfile (not the registry name) — it's the trust anchor for re-installs.
- [ ] On `401/403`, surface a remediation message pointing at `APM_REGISTRY_TOKEN_<NAME>`.

---

## 9. Reference test fixtures

A conformance test suite for server implementers SHOULD exercise:

### 9.1 Round-trip publish-then-fetch

1. `PUT .../versions/1.0.0` with a valid tar.gz body → `201` with the right digest.
2. `GET .../versions/1.0.0/download` → returns the same bytes.
3. sha256 of the returned bytes equals the digest from the `201` response.
4. `GET .../versions` → contains the `1.0.0` entry with the same digest.

### 9.2 Immutability

1. `PUT .../versions/1.0.0` → `201`.
2. `PUT .../versions/1.0.0` (same body) → `409`.
3. `PUT .../versions/1.0.0` (different body) → `409`.

### 9.3 Format dispatch

1. `PUT .../versions/1.0.0` with `Content-Type: application/zip` → `201`.
2. `GET .../versions/1.0.0/download` → returns `Content-Type: application/zip` and the same bytes.
3. Hash matches.

### 9.4 Validation

1. `PUT` with a tarball missing `apm.yml` → `422` with appropriate error message.
2. `PUT` with `apm.yml.version` ≠ URL version → `422`.
3. `PUT` with absolute paths in tar → `422`.
4. `PUT` with symlink in zip → `422`.

### 9.5 Auth

1. Anonymous `GET /versions` on a public package → `200` (or `401` on private registry).
2. `GET /versions` with token lacking `read` scope → `403`.
3. `PUT` with token lacking `publish` scope → `403`.
4. `PUT` with no token → `401`.

### 9.6 Error format

1. Any `4xx` response has `Content-Type: application/problem+json`.
2. Body is valid JSON with at least `title` and `status`.

---

## Changelog

- Initial release — `versions`, `download`, `publish`. tar.gz + zip both supported. RFC 7807 errors. Bearer auth. Immutable versions.
