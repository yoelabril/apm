    It started this refactor at 2905 LOC. The post-P2 actual is ~1268 LOC.
    Budget is set with headroom for follow-ups; tighten when further
    extractions land.

    NOTE TO AGENTS: when this test fails, do NOT trim the file by deleting
    comments, collapsing whitespace, or inlining helpers to dodge the
    budget. Engage the python-architecture skill
    (.github/skills/python-architecture/SKILL.md) and propose a real
    extraction into apm_cli/install/ -- modularity is what gets us back
    under budget honestly. The python-architect agent persona owns these
    decisions; trimming LOC for its own sake is the anti-pattern this
    invariant exists to catch.

    PR #810 raised the ceiling 1500 -> 1525 to land the MCP install
    surface (--mcp / --registry / chaos-fix C1-C3, U1-U3). A python-
    architect follow-up will extract _maybe_handle_mcp_install() and
    tighten this back below 1500 with proper headroom.

    Issue #827 (W2-mcp-preflight) raised 1525 -> 1625 to land the
    --mcp policy preflight block. The preflight adds ~36 lines of
    policy enforcement wiring inside the --mcp branch. A python-
    architect extraction of the --mcp branch into
    apm_cli/install/_mcp_install.py should recover this budget.

    Issue #827 (W2-dry-run) raised 1625 -> 1650 to add policy
    preflight in preview mode to the --dry-run block (+17 lines).
    The call lives in install.py because it coordinates between
    policy discovery and the existing render_and_exit presenter.
    The pending --mcp extraction will recover all #827 headroom.

    Issue #827 (C2-S1) raised 1650 -> 1675 to add a second
    run_policy_preflight call guarding transitive MCP servers
    collected from installed APM packages (+23 lines). This is a
    security-critical gate: without it, transitive MCP servers
    bypass policy enforcement entirely (panel blocker S1).
    The pending --mcp extraction will recover this budget.

    PR #832 (review fix) raised 1675 -> 1680 to land the
    PolicyViolationError unwrap in the install error handler so the
    user sees the policy message verbatim instead of double-nested
    under "Failed to install ... Failed to resolve ..." (+5 lines:
    one import + four error-handler lines). Recovered by the same
    pending --mcp extraction.
    PR #852 (panel fix B7) raised 1680 -> 1690 to add the
    HACK(#852) try/finally cleanup around APM_VERBOSE so that the
    env-var mutation that surfaces --verbose to the auth layer does
    not leak past this command invocation (+10 lines: 4-line save
    block at function entry + 6-line finally block at function exit).
    The follow-up issue tracks threading verbose state through
    AuthResolver as a constructor arg, after which both blocks can
    be deleted.

    PR #856 (post-PR review fix C1+F2/F3) raised 1690 -> 1700 to:
    move ``_apm_verbose_prev`` initialisation outside the ``try:``
    so the ``finally`` clause never sees an UnboundLocalError if
    ``InstallLogger(...)`` raises (+1 line C1) and to wire the
    InstallLogger into AuthResolver via ``set_logger()`` so the
    deferred stale-PAT diagnostic and verbose auth-source line route
    through CommandLogger / DiagnosticCollector instead of stderr
    (+5 lines comment + call F2/F3). Both will be recovered by the
    same pending --mcp extraction.

    WI-3 (complexity audit) raised 1700 -> 1950 for god-function
    decomposition within the same file.  The net +235 LOC comes from
    function-definition overhead (signatures, docstrings, blank lines)
    of the seven extracted helpers and the ``InstallContext`` dataclass.
    Cyclomatic complexity of ``install()`` dropped from ~70 to ~15 and
    ``_validate_and_add_packages_to_apm_yml()`` from ~50 to ~10.  This
    is a structural improvement, not feature growth -- the follow-up
    file-split into ``apm_cli/install/`` will recover the budget.

    PR #803 rebase follow-up raised 1950 -> 1980 to keep the
    scope-aware Codex MCP arguments threaded through the extracted
    ``_install_apm_packages()`` helper after upstream rebases. This is
    still helper overhead inside the same pending file-split work, not
    new install surface area.
    PR #999 (Ruff guardrails) raised 1980 -> 2100 for noqa directives
    added during mass linting rollout. These are suppression comments on
    pre-existing patterns (F401, RUF013, B904, etc.) that make violations
    visible and searchable. The line count increase is mechanical, not
    new logic -- each noqa is a cleanup target for future PRs.

    Post-rebase (main merged into #999) install.py shrank from 2100 to
    ~1700 as upstream refactors extracted helpers. Budget tightened to
    1800 to track the improvement.

    Issue #737 (skills convergence) raised 1800 -> 1825 to land the
    ``--legacy-skill-paths`` opt-out flag plumbing through ``install()``
    and ``InstallContext`` so users can opt back into per-client skill
    paths during the .agents/ convergence migration window. The pending
    --mcp extraction will recover this budget.
