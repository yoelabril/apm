"""Regression tests for the windsurf uninstall-cleanup bug (#1481):
``apm uninstall`` silently failed to remove deployed skill directories
under ``.windsurf/skills/``.

The fix dropped the ``agents`` primitive from the windsurf
``TargetProfile`` so that the deploy path ``.windsurf/skills/<name>/``
is owned exclusively by the ``skills`` primitive.  These tests pin the
post-fix shape of the windsurf profile and the directory-aware cleanup
path so a future regression -- e.g. re-introducing an ``agents``
primitive that aliases the same deploy path -- is caught here instead
of silently corrupting an end-user workspace.
